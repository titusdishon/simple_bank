# Simple Banking application

In this project, I will be implementing simple banking application with ability to create an account and handle transfers

Through the project I have had the opportunity to work with:

## PostgreSQL

## Db Transactions to achieve:

- Atomicity
- Consistency
- Isolation
- Durability

## Docker for containerization

## Unit and integration testing

## Gin framework for building APIs

## SQLC for generating CRUD code

## dbdiagram.io for designing database

## dbdocs for generating db documentation

## GRPC as an alternate to REST APIs

- Grpc will be useful for implementation the HTTP2 which offers a higher speed and performance than HTTP V1

## Test coverage
